Hi, my name is Filipe Azevedo.
<p>I was born in a small town in the North of Portugal called Vila do Conde. I received the diploma in 1999, the M.Sc. in 2003, both in Electrical and Computer Engineering from <a href="https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/web_page.inicial">Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP)</a>, Porto, Portugal, and the Ph.D. degree in 2008 on Electrical and Computer Engineering from <a href="https://www.utad.pt/">University of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro (UTAD)</a>, Vila Real, Portugal. </p>
<p>Currently I am an Associate Professor of Power Systems at the <a href="https://isep.pt/">School of Engineering, Polytechnic Institute of Porto (ISEP/IPP)</a> and a researcher at <a href="https://www.inesctec.pt/pt/pessoas/filipe-azevedo">Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering, Technology and Science (INESC TEC)</a>, both in Porto, Portugal.</p>
<p>My main research interests are Economics applied to Energy Markets, Decision-Support System techniques applied to Economics Engineering problems, Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) applications, Smart Grids, and Renewable Energy production integration on power systems. I have also interests in National Security related problems, encryption and cryptography.</p>
